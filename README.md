# AltSchool Assignment 2

This project contains three web pages built with **pure HTML (no CSS or JavaScript)** to demonstrate my understanding of semantic HTML structure, tables, and media elements.

## ðŸ“„ Pages Included

1. **index.html** â€“ Homepage with a short introduction about me.
2. **table.html** â€“ A table showcasing the different schools and their respective courses at AltSchool Africa.
3. **media.html** â€“ A media-rich page with a video, audio, and a responsive image using the `<picture>` element to pass a powerful message about myself.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- All files were created without using any CSS, as required.
- The `media.html` page includes a clarification comment explaining limitations of media queries without CSS.
- All media files are stored inside the `/assets` folder with proper organization for images, videos, and audio.

## âœ… How to View
Download or clone the repo, and open each `.html` file directly in your browser.
