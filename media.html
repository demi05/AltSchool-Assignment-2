    <!-- Clarification: I understand that i need to show 3 media sources to show respopnsiveness. However, the picture tag does not allow for sources other than images. Meaning I can not do this using the picture tag. Also, since I am not supposed to use css, I can not use media queries to show different media sources for different screen sizes. 

    However, all sources show on the screen at the same time. I added 3 seperate images to show that I understand how to use the picture tag. I hope this suffices for the assignment. -->
