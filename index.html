          I am a developer with a passion for creating visually appealing
          websites. I am a 4th year student of The University of Ibadan,
          studying <strong> Computer Science</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not developing, you will usually find me scrolling on
          Instagram, watching a great movie or series and most likely listening
          to Taylor Swift (she is the bestðŸ¥º).

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why am I in the program?</h2>
        <p>I joined the AltSchool program for the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Even though I already have some knowledge in frontend development, I
            feel like it is not enough.
          </li>
          <li>I joined in order to upskill.</li>
          <li>I also joined in order to become a better developer.</li>
          <li>
            Most importantly, the knowledge I will gain in the AltSchool program
            will enable me to actually land high paying jobs in a field I really
            love.
